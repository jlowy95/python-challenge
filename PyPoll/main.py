""" PyPoll

You will be give a set of poll data called election_data.csv. 
The dataset has three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. 
Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes 
and calculates each of the following:
1. The total number of votes cast
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
3. The percentage of votes each candidate won
4. The total number of votes each candidate won
5. The winner of the election based on popular vote.
