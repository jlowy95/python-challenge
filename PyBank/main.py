# PyBank Challenge
#
# Create a Python script that analyzes the records
# to calculate each of the following:
# 1. total number of months included in the dataset
# 2. net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
# 3. average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
# 4. greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
# 5. greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
# Write the results to both the terminal and a text file


# OS Library for compatibility across platforms reading file paths
import os
# CSV Library for use of the .csv data files
import csv


# Set the file path to "budget_data.csv" as "bd_filepath"
bd_filepath = os.path.join("..","PyBank","budget_data.csv")

# Variables
# Initialize month counter to 0
months_count = 0
# Initialize profit/loss total to 0
net_total = 0
# Average will be calculated as: (end value - initial value)/months_count
# These values will be assigned within the csv file work loop
# Greatest increase/decrease in p/l will be recorded by "profit_max" and 
# "loss_max" respectively.  Their accompanying months will be recorded by
# "profit_month" and "loss_month".  These will be initialized to the
# first month's values.
profit_max = 0
loss_max = 0
